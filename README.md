# sigfox_electrical_meter

## Description
This project will show you how to get your electricity consumption using a small device plugged onto your electrical meter. Note that it only works with the "Compteur Electrique Triphasé agréé EDF, ECS, 60A / 40KWh Multi Tarifs". This model is very common in France.

Basically, on this electrical meter, a LED blinks every time a Wh is consumed. So the idea is to record this blink and link it to a counter and then every hour send it to a server using Sigfox network.

## Which microcontrollers will be used?

We will be using the Akeru dev kit (from SnootLab)

Other dev kits are available on Sigfox Partners Network.

## Does it work on all electrical meters?

No unfortunately it only works on the "Compteur Electrique Triphasé agréé EDF, ECS, 60A / 40KWh Multi Tarifs" which are very common in France. Feel free to try to adapt it and share your solutions!

## How long does it take to make it?

All the source code is available on Github. So, in an hour or two you will be able to make it work.
If you want to print the adapter, I have been using 3D hubs and I received it in two days.

## Do I need any previous knowledge?

You don't need any previous knowledge although knowing Arduino and CAD design is a plus.

## Who am I?

My name is Louis Moreau, I'm an intern at Sigfox. My mission is to create prototypes and PoC using Sigfox network. I want these projects to be fun and instructive. I want to show you how easy is it to develop the first steps of your ideas. I will try to make this tutorial as complete as I can. Do not hesitate to ask me for more details if needed : Github
